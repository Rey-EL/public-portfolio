## Key Skills

My journey through various projects has equipped me with a robust and interconnected skill set across critical technical and cybersecurity domains. I thrive on building secure, efficient, and innovative solutions, and my portfolio reflects a hands-on approach to mastering complex challenges.

**My core proficiencies include:**

*   **Programming & Scripting:** I leverage Python for automation and GUI development (`tkinter`, `win32com`), alongside foundational C programming for structured logic, function implementation, and array management. My scripting expertise extends to Bash and Shell scripting, complemented by SQL for data manipulation and cybersecurity investigations. I am adept at algorithmic design, translating complex problems into clear flowcharts and pseudocode.

*   **Operating Systems & Administration:** I possess strong capabilities in both Linux and Windows environments. This includes comprehensive Linux administration (installation, configuration, hardening, user/group management, file operations, BASH scripting) and extensive Windows Server administration (deployment, management, monitoring, troubleshooting, Active Directory, Group Policy, DNS, DHCP, Certificate Services). I am also proficient in Windows client management, system configuration, maintenance, and disaster recovery.

*   **Networking & Infrastructure:** My expertise spans network design, configuration, and troubleshooting for both enterprise and small-scale environments. I am skilled in routing and switching technologies (Cisco IOS, OSPF, VLANs, InterVLAN Routing, Dynamic/Static/Default Routing Protocols), Network Address Translation (NAT), Subnetting (VLSM), LAN/WAN Connectivity, Network Services Configuration (DHCP, DNS, IP Services), Network Troubleshooting, Wireless Network Security, IP Addressing (IPv4, IPv6), Network Architecture Design, Network Automation (Ansible, Puppet, Chef, SDN, SDA, REST, JSON, APIs), Firewall Rules, Network Protocols (TCP/IP, UDP, LLDP, MPLS, NTP, SSH, Telnet, Syslog), SOHO Networks, VPN, Wi-Fi.

*   **Cybersecurity Concepts & Frameworks:** I apply industry-standard frameworks like NIST (SP 800-30, SP 800-53, Cybersecurity Framework) and OWASP Top 10 for vulnerability assessment, risk analysis, and incident response (Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover). My understanding of security concepts includes Access Control (Least Privilege, AAA, RBAC, MFA), Security Control Implementation (Defense-in-Depth), Threat Hunting, Data Auditing, Security Architecture, and the CIA Triad. I am familiar with Kernel Security, Buffer Overflow, SQL Injection mitigation, Mobile Device Management (MDM), Penetration Testing, Secure Protocols, Social Engineering, and Digital Forensics.

*   **Virtualization & Cloud:** I have hands-on experience with Hyper-V Virtualization and containerization using Docker. My knowledge of cloud computing fundamentals encompasses concepts, characteristics, delivery models, and benefits, with practical skills in cloud model analysis (Public, Private, Hybrid), resource management (compute, storage), and disaster recovery implementation in cloud-based environments (AWS, KVM, VirtualBox, VMware, VPC, Xen).

*   **Tools & Utilities:** I am proficient with a wide array of tools, including Microsoft Visio and Packet Tracer for network visualization and simulation. My Python utilities demonstrate skills in SHA-256 Hashing, File I/O, Metadata Handling (`Pillow`), PDF Manipulation (`pypdf`), and PowerPoint Automation. I am adept at file organization tasks like duplicate file detection, empty directory removal, and intelligent file renaming. I utilize Linux commands (`chmod`, `ls -la`), and security tools such as IDS/IPS, SIEM, Microsoft Management Consoles (MMC), Windows Defender Firewall, File History, System Restore, Greenshot, ASLR, Cryptography, DAC, EVM, IMA, iptables, Netfilter, PAM, SELinux, Seccomp, and TPM.
