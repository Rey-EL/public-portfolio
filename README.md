## Python Utility Scripts

This section features a series of standalone GUI applications built with Python and Tkinter. Each tool is designed to solve a common file management problem and can be bundled into a standalone Windows executable using PyInstaller.

### [file-janitor](./file-janitor)
*   **Purpose:** A Python script to clean and organize folders by finding and removing duplicate files and empty directories.
*   **Skills Demonstrated:** Python, `tkinter`, `tqdm`, SHA-256 Hashing, File I/O.

### [media-tidy](./media-tidy)
*   **Purpose:** A Python script to organize photo and video libraries by renaming files based on EXIF data and moving them into a structured `Images` and `Videos` directory.
*   **Skills Demonstrated:** Python, `Pillow` (for EXIF data), `tkinter`, `tqdm`, Metadata Handling.

### [pdf-merger](./pdf-merger)
*   **Purpose:** A Python script with a GUI to merge multiple PDF files into a single document.
*   **Skills Demonstrated:** Python, `pypdf`, `tkinter`, GUI Development.

### [ppt-to-pdf-converter](./ppt-to-pdf-converter)
*   **Purpose:** A Windows-only Python script to convert PowerPoint presentations (`.ppt`, `.pptx`) to PDF files and merge them.
*   **Skills Demonstrated:** Python, `win32com`, `pypdf`, `tkinter`, COM Automation.

## Cybersecurity & IT Labs

This section contains reports and analyses from practical lab exercises, showcasing my ability to apply security principles and use industry-standard frameworks.

### [sec-plus-guide](./sec-plus-guide)
*   **Purpose:** A comprehensive study guide for the CompTIA Security+ exam, organized by official domains.
*   **Skills Demonstrated:** Security Concepts, Threat Management, Security Architecture, Security Operations, Governance & Compliance.

### [nist-ddos-incident-report](./nist-ddos-incident-report)
*   **Purpose:** A formal incident report analyzing a DDoS attack using the five functions of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover).
*   **Skills Demonstrated:** Incident Analysis, NIST Cybersecurity Framework, Network Security, Incident Response.

### [google-data-leak-incident-activity](./google-data-leak-incident-activity)
*   **Purpose:** An analysis of a data leak incident, identifying failures in security controls and recommending improvements based on the NIST Cybersecurity Framework and NIST SP 800-53.
*   **Skills Demonstrated:** Incident Analysis, NIST SP 800-53, Access Control (Principle of Least Privilege).

### [google-sql-filtering-lab](./google-sql-filtering-lab)
*   **Purpose:** A hands-on lab demonstrating the use of SQL to query a database for security investigations, including filtering by time, date, and location to identify suspicious activity.
*   **Skills Demonstrated:** SQL, Threat Hunting, Data Auditing.

### [linux-least-privilege-lab](./linux-least-privilege-lab)
*   **Purpose:** A lab demonstrating a file permission audit and remediation in a Linux environment to enforce the Principle of Least Privilege.
