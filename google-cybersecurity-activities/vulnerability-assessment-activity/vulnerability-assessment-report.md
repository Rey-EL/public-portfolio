# Vulnerability Assessment Report
**Date:** Sunday, November 9, 2025

### System Description
The server hardware consists of a powerful CPU processor and 128GB of memory. It runs on the latest version of Linux operating system and hosts a MySQL database management system. It is configured with a stable network connection using IPv4 addresses and interacts with other servers on the network. Security measures include SSL/TLS encrypted connections.

### Scope
The scope of this vulnerability assessment relates to the current access controls of the system. The assessment will cover a period of three months, from June 20XX to August 20XX. NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1 is used to guide the risk analysis of the information system.

### Purpose
The purpose of this vulnerability assessment is to analyze the significant security risks associated with the company's publicly accessible customer database. This database is a critical business asset, as it is the primary tool for the global remote workforce to identify and engage potential customers. Securing this data is paramount to maintaining customer trust, protecting sensitive information, and ensuring regulatory compliance. A disruption or compromise of this server would directly impede revenue-generating activities and could inflict severe reputational and financial damage on the organization.

### Risk Assessment
| Threat Source          | Threat Event                                | Likelihood | Severity | Risk |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ---------- | -------- | ---- |
| Outsider (Hacker)      | Obtain sensitive information via exfiltration | 3 (High)   | 3 (High) | 9    |
| Group (Competitor)     | Conduct Denial of Service (DoS) attacks     | 2 (Mod)    | 3 (High) | 6    |
| Software (Malicious)   | Alter/Delete critical information           | 3 (High)   | 3 (High) | 9    |

### Approach
This qualitative vulnerability assessment was conducted to identify and evaluate the most immediate and significant risks to the business. The selected threat sources—external attackers, competitors, and malicious software—were chosen because the database server's public accessibility makes it a prime target for these threats. The identified threat events (data exfiltration, service disruption, and data destruction) directly compromise the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of the company's core customer data. Likelihood and severity scores were derived using the guidance in NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1, reflecting the high probability of an attack on an unsecured system and the catastrophic business impact of a data breach or system failure.

### Remediation Strategy
To address the identified risks, a "defense-in-depth" strategy is recommended, starting with the immediate implementation of proper access controls. The principle of least privilege must be enforced by placing the database behind a firewall and requiring all employees to connect via a secure Virtual Private Network (VPN) with multi-factor authentication (MFA). Furthermore, a robust Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) framework should be established. This will ensure that only authenticated users are granted access, their permissions are strictly limited to the data necessary for their roles, and all access is logged for auditing and security monitoring.
