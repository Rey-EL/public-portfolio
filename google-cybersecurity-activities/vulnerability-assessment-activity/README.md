# Portfolio Activity: Vulnerability Assessment for a Small Business

### Project Overview

This repository contains a vulnerability assessment report created as a portfolio activity for the **Google Cybersecurity Certificate program**. The project demonstrates the process of identifying, analyzing, and proposing remediation for security vulnerabilities within a realistic business scenario.

### Scenario

The subject of the assessment is a small e-commerce company that utilizes a remote database server to store customer information. This server has been openly accessible to the public internet since the company's inception three years ago, allowing a global remote workforce to query data. This configuration represents a critical security flaw.

The objective was to step into the role of a cybersecurity analyst, evaluate the risks posed by this vulnerability, and create a formal report for company stakeholders outlining the potential impact and a clear strategy for remediation.

### Methodology

The assessment was conducted using the **NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1, "Guide for Conducting Risk Assessments"** as a guiding framework. The process involved:

1.  **Defining Purpose:** Establishing the business-critical nature of the database and the importance of securing it.
2.  **Risk Identification:** Identifying potential threat sources (e.g., hackers, competitors) and corresponding threat events (e.g., data exfiltration, Denial of Service).
3.  **Risk Analysis:** Performing a qualitative risk analysis by assigning scores for **Likelihood** and **Severity** to calculate an overall **Risk** score for each identified threat.
4.  **Remediation Strategy:** Proposing a multi-layered "defense-in-depth" security strategy to mitigate the identified risks.

### Key Recommendations

The final report recommends several critical security controls to protect the vulnerable system, including:

*   **Implementing Network Segmentation:** Placing the database server behind a firewall to remove it from public access.
*   **Enforcing Secure Access:** Requiring all user connections through a **Virtual Private Network (VPN)** with **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**.
*   **Applying the Principle of Least Privilege:** Establishing a robust **Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) framework** to ensure users have only the minimum necessary permissions to perform their duties.

### Skills Demonstrated

*   **Risk Assessment & Management:** Applying the NIST framework to identify and quantify risk.
*   **Vulnerability Analysis:** Evaluating system weaknesses and their potential business impact.
*   **Security Control Implementation:** Recommending specific technical and operational controls (Defense-in-Depth, AAA, MFA, VPNs).
*   **Technical Communication:** Authoring a professional, clear, and concise report for technical and non-technical stakeholders.
*   **Understanding of the CIA Triad:** Analyzing threats to the Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability of data.
