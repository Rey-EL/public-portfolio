# Introduction to Operating Systems (CIS106)

## Course Overview
In this foundational course, I gained a comprehensive introduction to the essential hardware and software components that underpin computer-based operating systems. I explored both Windows and Linux environments, mastering basic system maintenance, terminal commands, and fundamental data security practices. The curriculum also covered virtualization concepts and various computer numbering systems. Through hands-on experience, I became proficient in configuring user interfaces, performing routine system maintenance, and executing critical data backup and recovery procedures.

## Key Learning Outcomes
- **Hardware and Software Analysis:** Developed the ability to compare and contrast diverse hardware components (RAM, hard disks, processors, graphics cards) and software types (operating systems, applications, virtualization, utilities).
- **System Configuration and Maintenance:** Utilized basic operating system and disk utilities to effectively perform system configuration and maintenance tasks, ensuring optimal performance.
- **Operating System History:** Gained an understanding of the historical evolution of operating systems, providing context for current technologies.
