# Intermediate to Routing and Switching (CIS204)

## Course Overview
In this intermediate course, I developed advanced skills in configuring networked routers and switches, gaining a deep understanding of network design principles. I mastered variable length subnetting (VLSM), network address translation (NAT), and the intricacies of both distance vector and link-state routing protocols. Through hands-on exercises, I became proficient in configuring access list-based security, establishing robust WAN connections, and effectively troubleshooting complex TCP/IP networks. I also solidified my understanding of the foundational OSI Model, particularly its first three layers.

## Key Learning Outcomes
- **TCP/IP Model Expertise:** Gained a thorough understanding of the transport and application layers of the TCP/IP model, enabling comprehensive network analysis.
- **IPv4 Access List Implementation:** Developed the ability to understand, evaluate, and apply IPv4 access lists for granular network security control.
- **Network Security Methods:** Characterized and implemented various network security methods and services, enhancing network resilience against threats.
- **IP Services Management:** Gained proficiency in characterizing and managing diverse IP services to optimize network performance and functionality.
- **Network Architecture Design:** Explored and characterized different network architectures, preparing me to design and implement scalable network solutions.
- **Network Automation Fundamentals:** Understood and characterized various methods of network automation, laying the groundwork for efficient network management and orchestration.
