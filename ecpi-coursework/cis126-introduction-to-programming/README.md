# Introduction to Programming (CIS126)

## Course Overview
In this introductory programming course, I was immersed in the structured concepts of a high-level programming language, specifically C. I mastered the fundamental syntax, including primitive data types, declarations, constants, variables, assignment operations, expression evaluation, and basic console input/output. By the end of this course, I was proficient in writing functional console programs using the C language, laying a strong foundation for further programming endeavors.

## Key Learning Outcomes
- **Structured Program Logic:** Developed and applied console programs incorporating sequential logic, looping constructs (e.g., `for`, `while`), and selection logic (e.g., `if-then-else`, `switch-case` structures).
- **C Functions Implementation:** Gained practical experience in designing and utilizing C functions to modularize code and enhance program efficiency.
- **Array Management:** Implemented console programs effectively using arrays for organizing and maintaining data sets within structured programs.
- **Formatted I/O:** Mastered formatted input and output operations in C, enabling precise control over data presentation and user interaction.
- **Algorithmic Design:** Created clear and concise flowcharts and pseudocode for structured, procedural programs, encompassing sequential, decision, and looping structures, demonstrating strong algorithmic thinking.
