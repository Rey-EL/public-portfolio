# Introduction to Programming (CIS126)

## Course Overview
This course will provide students with an introduction to structured concepts of a high-level programming language. Students will learn the basic syntax of a programming language. Students will learn about primitive data types, declarations, constants, variables, assignment operations, expression evaluation, and basic console I/O. Upon successful course completion, students will be able to write console programs using the C language.

## Key Learning Outcomes
- Determine & Apply console programs containing sequential program logic, looping constructs and selection logic (including if-then-else and case structures).
- Determine & Apply console programs using C functions.
- Determine & Apply console programs using arrays for maintaining data sets in a structured program.
- Determine & Apply console programs containing formatted input and output.
- Create Flowcharts or Pseudocode for structured, procedural programs that include sequential, decision, and looping structures.
