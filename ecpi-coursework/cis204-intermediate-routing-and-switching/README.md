# CIS204: Intermediate Routing and Switching

## Course Description
This course provides intermediate skill level topics for configuring networked routers and switches. Students will learn network design, variable length subnets, network address translation, details on distance vector and link state routing protocols. Upon successful completion, students will be able to configure access list based security, WAN connections and troubleshooting a TCP/IP network, as well as identify the first three layers of the OSI Model.

## Course Learning Outcomes
Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:
1. Explain the transport and application layers of the TCP/IP model.
2. Understand, evaluate, and apply IPv4 access lists.
3. Characterize different network security methods and services.
4. Characterize different IP services.
5. Characterize different network architectures.
6. Characterize different methods of network automation.

## Key Topics Covered
*   IP Access Control Lists (ACLs)
*   TCP and UDP Protocols
*   DHCP and DNS in Networking
*   Network Security (Malware, Man-in-the-Middle, Address Spoofing, Port Security)
*   Device Management Protocols (Syslog, NTP, CDP, LLDP)
*   Network Address Translation (NAT)
*   Network Architecture (LAN, WAN, QoS)
*   Network Automation (SDN, SDA, REST, JSON, Ansible, Puppet, Chef)
