# Introduction to Routing and Switching (CIS202)

## Course Overview
This course will provide students with intermediate level knowledge and skills for configuring networked routers and switches. Students will learn enterprise network design principles, including implementing InterVLAN routing and dynamic routing protocols. They will also learn network address translation, basic router and switch security, and standard access list usage. Upon successful completion, students will be able to design, configure, secure and troubleshoot a routed network.

## Key Learning Outcomes
- Contrast the processes used by routing and switching technologies.
- Demonstrate switched networking and switch configuration including VLANs.
- Configure standard LAN/WAN connections using IP.
- Given a network topology, configure and test static, default, and dynamic routing.
- Configure network services.
- Demonstrate router and switch security options including implementing an access list.
