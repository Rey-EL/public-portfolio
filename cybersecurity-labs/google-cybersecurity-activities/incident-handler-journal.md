# Ransomware Incident Handler's Journal

## Project Overview

This project is a practical exercise in applying foundational incident response procedures. It documents a simulated ransomware attack on a small U.S. healthcare clinic, initiated by a phishing email. The full journal entry, structured using the "5 W's" framework, is detailed below.

## Scenario

A small U.S. healthcare clinic was hit by a ransomware attack initiated by a phishing email. The attack encrypted critical files, including medical records, and led to a complete shutdown of business operations. The incident occurred on a Tuesday morning at approximately 9:00 a.m.

## The Incident Journal Entry

### Incident Details

| **Date:** | 2025-12-12 |
| **Entry:** | 1 |
| **Description** | Documented a ransomware attack on a small U.S. healthcare clinic. The incident was initiated by a phishing email and resulted in the encryption of critical files and a complete shutdown of business operations. |
| **Tool(s) used** | Not specified in the scenario. |

### The 5 W's of the Incident

*   **Who:** The incident was caused by an organized group of unethical hackers known for targeting healthcare organizations.
*   **What:** A ransomware attack encrypted critical files, including medical records. A ransom note was displayed demanding payment for the decryption key, leading to a shutdown of business operations.
*   **When:** The incident occurred on a Tuesday morning at approximately 9:00 a.m.
*   **Where:** The incident happened on the computer systems and network of a small U.S. healthcare clinic.
*   **Why:** The attack was successful because an employee downloaded a malicious attachment from a targeted phishing email, which installed the ransomware.

### Additional Notes and Observations

This incident highlights the critical need for employee training on identifying and responding to phishing attempts. It also underscores the importance of having a robust backup and recovery plan to restore operations without paying a ransom. A key question is what technical measures were in place (or lacking) that allowed the malware to execute and spread.

## Summary of Skills Demonstrated

*   **Incident Documentation:** Applying the "5 W's" framework (Who, What, When, Where, Why) to methodically document a security incident.
*   **Ransomware Analysis:** Understanding the mechanics and impact of ransomware attacks on critical systems and data.
*   **Phishing Attack Analysis:** Identifying phishing as a primary initial access vector for ransomware and its implications for employee training.
*   **Incident Response Principles:** Demonstrating foundational knowledge of incident response, including initial analysis and strategic recommendations for prevention and recovery.
*   **Strategic Security Recommendations:** Formulating actionable recommendations based on incident findings, covering both technical controls (e.g., backups) and human factors (e.g., security awareness training).

## Security Context

This exercise highlights the critical importance of a robust incident response plan, especially for prevalent threats like ransomware that target data availability and integrity (key components of the CIA triad). It underscores the vulnerability introduced by phishing attacks, which can bypass technical controls through social engineering. The necessity of proactive measures, such as employee security awareness training and comprehensive backup strategies, is paramount to mitigate risks, ensure business continuity, and defend against sophisticated attacks that could otherwise exploit vulnerabilities, including those related to "Security Misconfiguration" or "Identification and Authentication Failures" from the OWASP Top 10.
