| **Description** | Documented a ransomware attack on a small U.S. healthcare clinic. The incident was initiated by a phishing email and resulted in the encryption of critical files and a complete shutdown of business operations. |
| **Tool(s) used** | Not specified in the scenario. |
| **The 5 W's** | **Who:** The incident was caused by an organized group of unethical hackers known for targeting healthcare organizations. <br> **What:** A ransomware attack encrypted critical files, including medical records. A ransom note was displayed demanding payment for the decryption key, leading to a shutdown of business operations. <br> **When:** The incident occurred on a Tuesday morning at approximately 9:00 a.m. <br> **Where:** The incident happened on the computer systems and network of a small U.S. healthcare clinic. <br> **Why:** The attack was successful because an employee downloaded a malicious attachment from a targeted phishing email, which installed the ransomware. |
| **Additional notes** | This incident highlights the critical need for employee training on identifying and responding to phishing attempts. It also underscores the importance of having a robust backup and recovery plan to restore operations without paying a ransom. A key question is what technical measures were in place (or lacking) that allowed the malware to execute and spread. |
