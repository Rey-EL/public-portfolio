# Google Cybersecurity Certificate Labs

This repository contains a collection of hands-on projects, labs, and activities completed as part of the **Google Cybersecurity Certificate program**.

The purpose of this portfolio is to demonstrate the practical application of cybersecurity principles and tools in realistic scenarios. Each project is self-contained in its own directory and includes a detailed `README.md` explaining its objectives, the methodology used, and the skills demonstrated.

## Projects

*   **[Vulnerability Assessment for a Small Business Lab](./vulnerability-assessment-activity/README.md)**
    *   A project focused on conducting a formal vulnerability assessment using the NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1 framework to identify, analyze, and propose remediation for critical security risks.
*   **[Google Data Leak Analysis Lab](../google-data-leak-incident-activity/README.md)**
    *   An analysis of a data leak, identifying control failures and recommending improvements based on NIST SP 800-53.
*   **[Google SQL Filtering Lab](../google-sql-filtering-lab/README.md)**
    *   A lab demonstrating SQL for security investigations, including filtering by time, date, and location.
*   **[Linux Least Privilege Lab](../linux-least-privilege-lab/README.md)**
    *   A lab demonstrating a file permission audit and remediation in Linux to enforce the Principle of Least Privilege.
*   **[Parking Lot USB Exercise Lab](./parking-lot-usb-exercise/README.md)**
    *   An exercise demonstrating the risks of USB baiting and how to safely inspect unknown devices.
*   **[Completed Access Control Worksheet](./completed-access-control-worksheet.md)**
    *   This worksheet demonstrates the ability to analyze an access control scenario, identify authorization issues, and recommend appropriate technical, operational, and managerial controls. It showcases an understanding of concepts like Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and the principle of least privilege.
*   **[Completed Data Leak Worksheet](./completed-data-leak-worksheet.md)**
    *   This worksheet demonstrates the ability to analyze a data leak incident, identify the contributing factors, and recommend improvements based on the principle of least privilege (NIST SP 800-53: AC-6). It showcases an understanding of how to apply the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) to protect against data leaks.
*   **[Incident Handler's Journal](./incident-handler-journal.md)**
    *   This journal entry documents a ransomware incident at a healthcare clinic. It demonstrates the ability to apply the "5 W's" (Who, What, When, Where, Why) to document and analyze a security event, a foundational practice in incident response.
